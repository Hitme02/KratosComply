# Privacy Posture (Stage A Placeholder)

Comprehensive privacy guarantees will be documented as the agent and backend take shape. For now, the guiding principles are:

1. The agent must operate completely offline by default.
2. Uploads or attestations must be explicitly requested by the operator.
3. Private keys remain on-disk under strict permissions.

Later stages will expand this document with a threat model, data-flow diagrams, and operational guidance.
